* Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it. 
'world'  =>  'dlrow'


function solution(str){
    let inverse = ""
    for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

        inverse += str[i]
        console.log(i)
    }
    return inverse
}

* Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.



function past(h, m, s){
      if (h >= 0 && h <= 23 && m >= 0 && m <= 59 && s >= 0 && s <= 59) {
        let second = 1000 // a second has 1000 miliseconds
        let minute = 60 * second // a minute has 60 seconds
        let hour = 3600 * second // an hour has 3600 seconds

        return s * second + m * minute + h * hour
    }
}

* Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

function noSpace(x) {
    let noSpaceWord = ""
    for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (x[i] != " ") {
            noSpaceWord += x[i]
        }
    }
    return noSpaceWord
}

* Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new 
gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so 
one average score per team).
A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. 
Otherwise, no team wins

let averageScore = (score1, score2, score3) => (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3


let dolphinScore = averageScore(85, 54, 41)
let pandaScore = averageScore(23, 34, 27)

console.log(dolphinScore)
console.log(pandaScore)

function checkWinner(dolphinScore, pandaScore) {
    if (dolphinScore > pandaScore && dolphinScore / pandaScore >= 2) {
        return `Dolphin win ${dolphinScore} vs ${pandaScore}.`
    }

    if (pandaScore > dolphinScore && pandaScore / dolphinScore >= 2) {
        return `Panda win ${pandaScore} vs ${dolphinScore}.`
    }

    return "Draw!"

}

console.log(checkWinner(dolphinScore, pandaScore))
